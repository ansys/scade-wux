ansys.scade.wux.wux.add_cpp_options
===================================

.. py:function:: ansys.scade.wux.wux.add_cpp_options(project: scade.model.project.stdproject.Project, configuration: scade.model.project.stdproject.Configuration)

   
   Add the required compiler/linker options for C++ code.

   * This is required for GNU C: -static -lstdc++
   * There is no API in scade.code.suite.* to achieve this. The workaround
     consists in adding the option to the project for the given configuration.

   .. Note::

     * The option is set only if the current compiler is GNU C.
     * The project is modified but it is not expected to be saved in this context.
       Should it be saved, this is still fine since the option is mandatory.

   :Parameters:

       **project** : :obj:`Project`
           Input project.

       **configuration** : :obj:`Configuration`
           Input configuration.
