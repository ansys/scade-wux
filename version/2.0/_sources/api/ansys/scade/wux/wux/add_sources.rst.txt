ansys.scade.wux.wux.add_sources
===============================

.. py:function:: ansys.scade.wux.wux.add_sources(paths)

   
   Request the Code Generator to add sources files to the Makefile for C build.

   The source files are associated to the virtual service ``WUX``:
   Use the dependency ``WUX`` to declare a new target containing the sources
   from the generation services, either generated ones or runtime files.

   This function may be called by different generation services.
   It caches the added sources so that they are not added twice to the makefile.

   Refer to ``add_c_files`` in the User Documentation, section *Adding Make Directives*.

   :Parameters:

       **paths** : :obj:`List`\[:obj:`Path`]
           Paths of the C/C++ sources files to be added to the makefile.
